# Pytoshop

### Compiling and Running

-   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine then in the root directory, run:
-   ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
-   This will install necessary libraries like Tkinter for the UI, Pillow to load images, numpy to perform array operations, and matplotlib to draw figures
-   Then simply run the GUI file by doing:
-   ```
    python3 gui.py
    ```

### What and Why?

-   An easy to use Image Processing Toolbox that contains various operations to do on RGB and greyscale images
-   Built to get a better understanding of certain image processing techniques and how they work under the hood
-   There are many more operations that can be added such as object detection, image labeling, and also some bugs to iron out
-   Feel free to open a PR for literally anything
